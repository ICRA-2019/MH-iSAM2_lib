=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<MagneticField> reads in times and positions on standard input and
prints out the geomagnetic field on standard output and, optionally, its
rate of change.

The input line is of the form I<time> I<lat> I<lon> I<h>. I<time> is a
date of the form 2012-07-03 or a fractional year such as 2012.5.  I<lat>
and I<lon> are the latitude and longitude expressed as decimal degrees
or degrees, minutes, and seconds; see GeoConvert(1) for details.  I<h>
is the height above the ellipsoid in meters; this is optional and
defaults to zero.  Alternatively, I<time> can be given on the command
line as the argument to the B<-t> option, in which case it should not be
included on the input lines.  Finally, the magnetic field can be
computed at various points on a circle of latitude (constant I<time>,
I<lat>, and I<h>) via the B<-c> option; in this case only the longitude
should be given on the input lines.

The output consists of the following 7 items:

  the declination (the direction of the horizontal component of
    the magnetic field measured clockwise from north) in degrees,
  the inclination (the direction of the magnetic field measured
    down from the horizontal) in degrees,
  the horizontal field in nanotesla (nT),
  the north component of the field in nT,
  the east component of the field in nT,
  the vertical component of the field in nT (down is positive),
  the total field in nT.

If the B<-r> option is given, a second line is printed giving the rates
of change of these quantities in degrees/yr and nT/yr.

The WGS84 ellipsoid is used, I<a> = 6378137 m, I<f> = 1/298.257223563.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-n>

use magnetic field model I<name> instead of the default C<wmm2010>.  See
L</MODELS>.

=item B<-d>

read magnetic models from I<dir> instead of the default.  See
L</MODELS>.

=item B<-t>

evaluate the field at I<time> instead of reading the time from the input
lines.

=item B<-c>

evaluate the field on a circle of latitude given by I<time>, I<lat>,
I<h> instead of reading these quantities from the input lines.  In this
case, B<MagneticField> can calculate the field considerably more
quickly.

=item B<-r>

toggle whether to report the rates of change of the field.

=item B<-T>

signal an error if I<time> lies I<tguard> years (default 50 yr) beyond
the range for the model.

=item B<-H>

signal an error if I<h> lies I<hguard> meters (default 500000 m) beyond
the range for the model.

=item B<-p>

set the output precision to I<prec> (default 1).  Fields are printed
with precision with I<prec> decimal places; angles use I<prec> + 1
places.

=item B<-v>

print information about the magnetic model on standard error before
processing the input.

=item B<--comment-delimiter>

set the comment delimiter to I<commentdelim> (e.g., "#" or "//").  If
set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if found,
the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior to
processing and subsequently appended to the output line (separated by a
space).

=item B<--version>

print version and exit.

=item B<-h>

print usage, the default magnetic path and name, and exit.

=item B<--help>

print full documentation and exit.

=item B<--input-file>

read input from the file I<infile> instead of from standard input; a file
name of "-" stands for standard input.

=item B<--input-string>

read input from the string I<instring> instead of from standard input.
All occurrences of the line separator character (default is a semicolon)
in I<instring> are converted to newlines before the reading begins.

=item B<--line-separator>

set the line separator character to I<linesep>.  By default this is a
semicolon.

=item B<--output-file>

write output to the file I<outfile> instead of to standard output; a
file name of "-" stands for standard output.

=head1 MODELS

B<MagneticField> computes the geomagnetic field using one of the
following models

    wmm2010, the World Magnetic Model 2010, which approximates the
      main magnetic field for the period 2010–2015.  See
      http://ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/DoDWMM.shtml
    igrf11, the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (11th
      generation) which approximates the main magnetic field for
      the period 1900–2015.  See
      http://ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html
    emm2010, the Enhanced Magnetic Model 2010, which approximates the
      main and crustal magnetic fields for the period 2010–2015.  See
      http://ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/EMM/index.html

These models approximate the magnetic field due to the earth's core and
(in the case of emm2010) its crust.  They neglect magnetic fields due to
the ionosphere, the magnetosphere, nearby magnetized materials,
electrical machinery, etc.

By default, the C<wmm2010> magnetic model is used.  This may changed by
setting the environment variable C<MAGNETIC_NAME> or with the B<-n>
option.

The magnetic models will be loaded from a directory specified at compile
time.  This may changed by setting the environment variables
C<MAGNETIC_PATH> or C<GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA>, or with the B<-d> option.
The B<-h> option prints the default magnetic path and name.  Use the
B<-v> option to ascertain the full path name of the data file.

Instructions for downloading and installing magnetic models are
available at
L<http://geographiclib.sf.net/html/magnetic.html#magneticinst>.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item B<MAGNETIC_NAME>

Override the compile-time default magnetic name of C<wmm2010>.  The B<-h>
option reports the value of B<MAGNETIC_NAME>, if defined, otherwise it
reports the compile-time value.  If the B<-n> I<name> option is used,
then I<name> takes precedence.

=item B<MAGNETIC_PATH>

Override the compile-time default magnetic path.  This is typically
C</usr/local/share/GeographicLib/magnetic> on Unix-like systems and
C<C:/Documents and Settings/All Users/Application
Data/GeographicLib/magnetic> on Windows systems.  The B<-h> option reports
the value of B<MAGNETIC_PATH>, if defined, otherwise it reports the
compile-time value.  If the B<-d> I<dir> option is used, then I<dir>
takes precedence.

=item B<GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA>

Another way of overriding the compile-time default magnetic path.  If it
is set (and if B<MAGNETIC_PATH> is not set), then
$B<GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA>/magnetic is used.

=back

=head1 ERRORS

An illegal line of input will print an error message to standard output
beginning with C<ERROR:> and causes B<MagneticField> to return an exit
code of 1.  However, an error does not cause B<MagneticField> to
terminate; following lines will be converted.  If I<time> or I<h> are
outside the recommended ranges for the model (but inside the ranges
increase by I<tguard> and I<hguard>), a warning is printed on standard
error and the field (which may be inaccurate) is returned in the normal
way.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The magnetic field from WMM2010 in Timbuktu on 2012-01-01

    echo 2012-01-01 16:46:33N 3:00:34W 300 | MagneticField -r
    => -2.55 12.43 33771.0 33737.6 -1500.5 7446.0 34582.1
       0.10 -0.07 34.3 36.8 54.4 -35.3 25.9

The first two numbers returned are the declination and inclination of
the field.  The second line gives the annual change.
