The current version of the library is 1.35.

Changes between 1.35 (released 2014-03-13) and 1.34 versions:

   * Fix blunder in UTMUPS::EncodeEPSG (found by Ben Adler).

   * Matlab wrapper routines geodesic{direct,inverse,line} switch to
     "exact" routes if |f| > 0.02.

   * GeodSolve.cgi allows ellipsoid to be set (and uses the -E option
     for GeodSolve).

   * Set title in HTML versions of man pages for the utility programs.

   * Changes in cmake support:
     + add _d to names of executables in debug mode of Visual Studio;
     + add support for Android (cmake-only), thanks to Pullan Yu;
     + check CPACK version numbers supplied on command line;
     + configured version of project-config.cmake.in is
       project-config.cmake (instead of geographiclib-config.cmake), to
       prevent find_package incorrectly using this file;
     + fix tests with multi-line output;
     + this release includes a file, pom.xml, which is used by an
       experimental build system (based on maven) at SRI.

Changes between 1.34 (released 2013-12-11) and 1.33 versions:

   * Many changes in cmake support:
     + minimum version of cmake needed increased to 2.8.4 (which was
       released in 2011-02);
     + allow building both shared and static librarys with
       -D GEOGRAPHICLIB_LIB_TYPE=BOTH;
     + both shared and static libraries (Release plus Debug) included in
       binary installer;
     + find_package uses COMPONENTS and GeographicLib_USE_STATIC_LIBS to
       select the library to use;
     + find_package version checking allows nmake and Visual Studio
       generators to interoperate on Windows;
     + find_package (GeographicLib ...) requires that GeographicLib be
       capitalized correctly;
     + on Unix/Linux, don't include the version number in directory for
       the cmake configuration files;
     + defaults for GEOGRAPHICLIB_DOCUMENTATION and
       BUILD_NETGEOGRAPHICLIB are now OFF;
     + the GEOGRAPHICLIB_EXAMPLES configuration parameter is no longer
       used; cmake always configures to build the examples, but they are
       not built by default (instead build targets: exampleprograms and
       netexamples);
     + matlab-all target renamed to matlabinterface;
     + the configuration parameters PACKAGE_PATH and INSTALL_PATH are
       now deprecated (use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX instead);
     + on Linux, the installed package is relocatable;
     + on MacOSX, the installed utilities can find the shared library.

   * Use a more precise value for OSGB::CentralScale().

   * Add Arc routines to python interface.

   * The Geod utility has been removed; the same functionality lives on
     with GeodSolve (introduced in version 1.30).

Changes between 1.33 (released 2013-10-08) and 1.32 versions:

   * Add NETGeographic .NET wrapper library (courtesy of Scott Heiman).

   * Make inspector functions in GeographicLib::Ellipsoid const.

     specified incrementally.

   * Fix way flags for C++11 support are determined.

Changes between 1.31 (released 2013-07-01) and 1.30 versions:

     maintained):
     + overloaded versions of DMS::Encode,
       EllipticFunction::EllipticFunction, and
       GeoCoords::DMSRepresentation, have been eliminated by the use of
       optional arguments;
     + correct the declaration of first arg to UTMUPS::DecodeEPSG.

   * FIX BUG in GeographicLib::GravityCircle constructor (found by
     Mathieu Peyr√©ga) which caused bogus results for the gravity
     disturbance and gravity anomaly vectors. (This only affected

       Breidbach for the maven support);
     + FIX BUG: avoid altering input args in Fortran implementation;
     + more systematic treatment of very short geodesic;
     + fixes to python port so that they work with version 3.x, in
       addition to 2.x (courtesy of Amato);
     + accumulate the perimeter and area of polygons via a double-wide
       accumulator in Fortran, C, and Matlab implementations (this is
       already included in the other implementations);
     + port PolygonArea::AddEdge and PolygonArea::TestEdge to JavaScript
       and python interfaces;
     + include documentation on short geodesics.

   * Unix scripts for downloading datasets,
     geographiclib-get-{geoids,gravity,magnetic}, skip already download
     models by default, unless the -f flag is given.

   * FIX BUGS: meridian convergence and scale returned by
     TransverseMercatorExact was wrong at a pole.

   * Improve efficiency of MGRS::Forward by avoiding the calculation of
     the latitude if possible (adapting an idea of Craig Rollins).

   * Fixes to the way the Matlab interface routines are built (thanks to
     Phil Miller and Chris F.).

   * On MacOSX platforms with the cmake configuration, universal
     binaries are built.

Changes between 1.26 (released 2012-10-22) and 1.25 versions:

   * Changes to geodesic calculations:
     + restart Newton's method in Geodesic::Inverse when it goes awry;
     + back up Newton's method with the bisection method;
     + Geodesic::Inverse now converges for any value of f;
     + add GeodesicExact and GeodesicLineExact which are formulated in
       terms of elliptic integrals and thus yield accurate results
       even for very eccentric ellipsoids.
     + the -E option to Geod invokes these exact classes.

   * Add functionality to EllipticFunction:
     + add all the traditional elliptic integrals;
     + remove restrictions on argument range for incomplete elliptic

  * Add Math::AngNormalize and Math::AngNormalize2; the allowed range
    for longitudes and azimuths widened to [-540d, 540d).

  * DMS::Decode understands more unicode symbols.

  * Geohash uses geohash code "nan" to stand for not a number.

  * Add Ellipsoid::NormalCurvatureRadius.

  * Various fixes in LambertConformalConic, TransverseMercator,
    PolarStereographic, and Ellipsoid to handle reverse projections of
    points near infinity.

    + GeoConvert and Geod now accept a -: option.

  * GeoidEval does not print the gradient of the geoid height by default
    (because it's subject to large errors); give the -g option to get
    the gradient printed.

  * Work around optimization BUG in GeographicLib::Geodesic::Inverse
    with tdm mingw g++ version 4.6.1.

  * autoconf fixed to ensure that that out-of-sources builds work;

    for geoid, gravity, and magnetic data (instead of
    GEOGRAPHICLIB_GEOID_PATH, etc.); similarly, GeoidEval, Gravity, and
    MagneticField, look at the environment variable GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA
    to locate the data.

  * Spherical harmonic software changes:
    + capitalize enums SphericalHarmonic::FULL and
      SphericalHarmonic::SCHMIDT (the lower case names are retained but

  * Slight improvement in starting guess for solution of geographic
    latitude in terms of conformal latitude in TransverseMercator,
    TransverseMercatorExact, and LambertConformalConic.

  * For most classes, get rid of const member variables so that the
    default copy assignment works.

  * Put Math and Accumulator in their own header files.

  * Remove unused "fast" GeographicLib::Accumulator method.

  * Reorganize the Python interface.

    + trim precision of area to 3 decimal places;
    + FIX BUG with pole crossing edges (due to compiler optimization).

    and the geodesic area.

  * FIX BUGS (compiler-specific) in inverse geodesic calculations.

  * FIX BUG: accommodate tellg() returning -1 at end of string.

  * Change way flattening of the ellipsoid is specified:
    + constructors take f argument which is taken to be the flattening
      if f < 1 and the inverse flattening otherwise (this is a
      compatible change for spheres and oblate ellipsoids, but it is an
      INCOMPATIBLE change for prolate ellipsoids);
    + the -e arguments to the Utility Programs are handled similarly; in
      addition, simple fractions, e.g., 1/297, can be used for the
      flattening;

      deprecate Constants::WGS84_r() for the inverse flattening);
    + most classes have a Flattening() member function;

      geoid;
    + Add --msltohae and --haetomsl as GeoidEval options (and don't
      document the single hyphen versions).

  * Remove documentation that duplicates papers on transverse Mercator
    and geodesics.

      the prime meridian.
    + Include sufficient edge data to allow heights to be returned for
      cached area without disk reads;
    + Add inspector functions to query the extent of the cache.

  * Several house-cleaning changes:
    + Change from the a flat directory structure to a more easily
      maintained one.
    + Introduce Math class for common mathematical functions (in
      Constants.hpp).
    + Use Math::real as the type for all real quantities.  By default this
      is typedef'ed to double; and the library should be installed this
      way.
    + Eliminate const reference members of AzimuthalEquidistant,
      CassiniSoldner and LocalCartesian so that they may be copied.
    + Make several constructors explicit.  Disallow some constructors.
